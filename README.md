# PROSPER_app

## Description

This is a github repository to develop the PROSPER_app in the streeamlit framework. 


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hirotaka-i/PROSPER_app.git
```

## Create and activate pyenv
please note that the author has the python version of 3.9.6. You can check your version of python by `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If your python version is too old, the package won't work as expected somtimes. If you do not have the right version of python, please install it.

## Set up a virtual environment
To avoid the package dependency problems, we will use virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```


Then we need to activate the virtual environment which varies depending on your OS.
```
source .venv/bin/activate # Mac
```
```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows
```


Please confirm that you have the `(.venv)` in the terminal after activation. Then, update the pip and install the requirement packages in the requirements.txt file.    
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to go! Just run 
```
streamlit run app.py
```
The stremalit app will be launched in your browser. If you would like to stop the app, just press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

You can also connect the folder to your github account or other remote repository. Please refer to the github documentation for more details.

## Deactivate the virtual environment / delete the app
When you finish developing/running the app, please deactivate the virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal.

```
When you want to come back, you just activate the virtual environment again by running the following command in the terminal. As  you did before.
